## 研究内容

My research focuses on utilizing and developing advanced transmission electron microscopy techniques to investigate atomic-scale mechanisms,such as atomic arrangements, defects, chemical composition, and electromagnetic fields in emerging semiconductor materials，and observing their dynamic structural evolution under operating external fields to inform the development of next-generation information funtional devices.
